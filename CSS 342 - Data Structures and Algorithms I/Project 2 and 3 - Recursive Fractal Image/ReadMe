This is the combination of project 2 and 3.
Project 2 was making my own image class from the Image Library with well defined parameters as well as getters and setters
newImage class is my implemetation of my own image library class based on the ImageLib

Project 3 was using my image class to create a recursive fractal image as defined by the professor. The driver handles a lot of the recurssion.
The rectangle class is used to define image sizes in the fractal images, as well as placement in the whole image.

fox.gif is the input, and output.gif is the output.
