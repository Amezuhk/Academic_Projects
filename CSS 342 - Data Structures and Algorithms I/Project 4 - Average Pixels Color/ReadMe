This project uses my image class newImage and applies a filter to an image.
It goes through the image and selects groups of pixels that are similar and combines all their colors into one value and applies that to
the whole group of pixels. 
This uses linked lists to manage pixel groupings and makes sure that no pixel is accessed twice
The process goes from top left to the bottom right until all the pixels are processed.
The linkedPixel class is my linkedlist implementation.
The input is fox and the output is output.
