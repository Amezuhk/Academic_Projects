This is a team Project that I did with Team Rocket, Evelyn Mahasin, and Kay Pham
The project is to create a dissassembler for the motorolla 68k assembly language. Parsing the bits from a 
given address space in the system and parsing them into the assembly language.
We split the project into 3 parts, I/O, Opcodes, and Effective Addresses.
I worked on the effective addresses for this project.
The output is shown based on the test that is parsed.
